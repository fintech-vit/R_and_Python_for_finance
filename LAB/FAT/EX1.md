# Python Basics

1) Write a well-structured Python class for a Student Attendance Management System? The class should allow adding students with a unique ID and name, marking attendance for specific dates with statuses like 'Present' or 'Absent', retrieving a student's attendance record, and generating a summary report that includes the total number of days attended and attendance percentage. The implementation should ensure data integrity and include error handling for cases like duplicate student entries or missing student records.
